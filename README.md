# AI in Creative Industries: Reddit Behavioral Analysis  
### Team №17: Sofiia Zakharuk (CS-2)  
  
This project analyzes the impact of Generative AI on creative communities on Reddit. We examined over 2.5 million interactions (comments and submissions) across 10 subreddits (Art, illustration, DigitalArt, painting, graphic_design, photography, writing, copywriting, blender, gamedev) over a 6-year period (2018–2024) to understand shifts in sentiment, activity, and professional discourse.
